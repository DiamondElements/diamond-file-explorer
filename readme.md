# Diamond File Explorer
Diamond File Explorer is a file explorer built for [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). It is designed to demo some of the capibilities of the [DiamondElements](https://github.com/DiamondElements).

### Usage
```
bower install && npm install && npm start
```


Currently has a bug where the elements might not upgrade on first launch. Refreshing the page seems to fix the issue. 
`cmd+r` to refresh.
